The Dysporium SDK is a modern TypeScript SDK for building AI applications. It's type-safe, streaming-first, and designed for production scale.

## What is Dysporium SDK?

Dysporium SDK provides a unified interface for working with AI language models and embeddings. It's built with TypeScript from the ground up, offering:

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with end-to-end type inference
- **Streaming First**: Built-in support for streaming responses
- **Provider Agnostic**: Modular provider system with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Qwen support
- **Production Ready**: Designed for scale with retry logic, error handling, and more

## Quick Install

Install the OpenAI provider package (which includes core):

```bash npm
npm install @dysporium-sdk/openai
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @dysporium-sdk/openai
```

Or install packages individually:

```bash npm
npm install @dysporium-sdk/core @dysporium-sdk/openai
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @dysporium-sdk/core @dysporium-sdk/openai
```

## Your First Request

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```typescript
import { createOpenAI } from '@dysporium-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from '@dysporium-sdk/core';

// Create an OpenAI provider
const openai = createOpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

// Generate text
const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-5.1'),
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});

console.log(result.text);
```
