## Package Installation

Dysporium SDK is split into multiple packages for modularity:

### Option 1: All-in-One (Recommended)

Install the OpenAI package which includes everything you need:

```bash npm
npm install @dysporium-sdk/openai
```

This includes:
- `@dysporium-sdk/core` - Core functionality
- `@dysporium-sdk/openai` - OpenAI provider
- `@dysporium-sdk/provider` - Provider interfaces

### Option 2: Individual Packages

Install packages separately for more control:

```bash npm
npm install @dysporium-sdk/core @dysporium-sdk/openai
```

```

Or create a `.env` file:

### Node.js Version

Requires Node.js 18+ for native async/await and modern JavaScript features.

import { createOpenAI } from '@dysporium-sdk/openai';
